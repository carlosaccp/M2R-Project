Relevant parts:
- Laub_15: up to page 6 (included) + Definition 7 (Mutually exciting 
process) + Section 4 (Parameter estimation), starting on page 12 and 
ending on page 17; this is a very good reference, the best one in my 
opinion.
- Rizoiu_17: up to page 8 (included) - nice introduction to point 
processes;
- Pawitan_01: very nice and gentle introduction to likelihood calculation 
in point processes (pages 320-322).
